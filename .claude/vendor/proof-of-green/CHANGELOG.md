# Changelog

## 0.7.0 (2026-11-01)

- `git checkout` and `git restore` count as edits of the paths they name: `git checkout -- a.js`, `git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/`, `git restore .`, also with `git -C dir`. `git restore --staged` alone, `git checkout -b` and `git switch` don't count.
- `git apply` and `patch` count the code files named in the patch, with `-p`, `-d` and `-i` applied. git apply's paths are taken from the repository root. A patch read through `<` or given as a heredoc (`git apply <<'EOF'`) counts too.
- `git checkout` left the Known limits list. Git commands that change the whole working tree are listed there instead.
- Deleting a code file counts as an edit: `rm`, `unlink`, `git rm`, `Remove-Item`, `ri`, `del` and `erase`. `git mv` counts like `mv`. `git rm --cached` and `git rm -n` don't count.
- PowerShell writes that count as edits: `New-Item` with `-Value` (also `ni`), `Tee-Object`, and `[IO.File]::WriteAllText`, `WriteAllLines`, `WriteAllBytes`, `AppendAllText` and `AppendAllLines` with a literal path. `New-Item` without `-Value` makes an empty file and doesn't count.
- A test run through a listed MCP tool with its exit code hidden (`npm test | tail`) now gets the hidden-exit-code block reason, as a shell run does. Before, the reason said no test had run.
- `status` marks a test command whose exit code was hidden as `[test, exit code hidden]` instead of `[not a test]`, matching the block reason. `status --json` gives it `masked: true`.
- More test commands count: `vitest`, `jest`, `ava` and `tap` run without `npx`, from `node_modules/.bin` or with `npx --yes`; `cypress run`, `karma start`, `ng test`; `vendor/bin/phpunit` and `pest`; and the test task of `turbo`, `nx`, `deno task`, `mise run` and `task`. Before, the gate blocked after these tests ran.
- Test commands of more languages count: `python manage.py test`, `bazel test`, `xcodebuild test`, `gotestsum`, `rake spec`, `stack test`, `cabal test`, `dune test`, `meson test`, `ninja test`, `lein test`, `clojure -X:test`, `nimble test`, `busted`, `R CMD check`, `rye test` and `uvx --with ... pytest`. `pixi run` and `conda run` are skipped like `uv run`.
- Old ledgers are pruned at most once an hour instead of on every hook call, so a hook no longer scans the ledger folder each time. A `.last-prune` file in that folder records the last scan.

## 0.6.0 (2026-11-01)

- When a test ran but its exit code was hidden (`npm test | tail`, `npm test; git push`), the block reason now names that command and says to join anything after the test with `&&`. Before, it said no test had run.
- Package manager options before the script name count: `npm --prefix api test`, `npm -w pkg test`, `pnpm -C api test`, `pnpm --filter web test`, `yarn workspace web test`. A flag value is never read as the script name, so `npm --prefix test install` is not a test. Gradle and Maven accept flags, `clean`, task paths such as `./gradlew :app:test` and variant tasks such as `testDebugUnitTest`.
- Forms that run no tests do not count: `-DskipTests`, `-Dmaven.test.skip`, `gradle --dry-run`, `-m` or `-x test`, `tox --notest`, `tox -l`, `nox --list`, a `tox -e` or `nox -s` session that is not a test session, `ctest -N` and `swift test --list-tests`.
- New test runners: `bundle exec rspec`, `rake test`, `rails test`, `swift test`, `flutter test`, `dart test`, `sbt test`, `zig build test`, `ctest`, `php artisan test`, `composer test`, `just test`, `tox`, `nox`, `hatch test` and `uvx pytest`.
- `cp`, `mv`, `Copy-Item` and `Move-Item` (also `copy`, `cpi`, `move`, `mi`) count as edits. A copy into a directory counts as the file it puts there, a move also counts its source, and copying a whole directory counts up to 50 code files under the result.
- `doctor` shows the five newest errors as one dated line each, sorted across ledger folders, instead of the last raw lines of the log.

## 0.5.0 (2026-11-01)

- Shell commands that write a code file now count as edits, on Claude Code and Codex: `>` and `>>` redirections, `tee`, `sed -i`, `perl -i`, and PowerShell's `Set-Content`, `Add-Content` and `Out-File`. Before, an agent could change code with `sed -i` and stop without a test. Other ways of writing files through the shell are listed under Known limits.
- Order inside one command is kept: `sed -i ... a.js && npm test` allows the stop, `npm test && sed -i ... a.js` blocks it.
- A file operand that holds a variable is skipped, but a variable in the script does not hide the file: `sed -i "$script" a.js` still counts.

## 0.4.0 (2026-11-01)

- `proof-of-green uninstall codex` removes the two Codex hooks that `install codex` added and the copied gate. Other hooks, the ledgers and Codex's `config.toml` are left as they are. Running it again changes nothing.
- The note for a subagent that hasn't stopped yet now says it "has not reported a stop yet" instead of "is still running". A subagent that was killed never reports a stop, so the old wording could be wrong.
- README: rewritten for first-time readers. The Uninstall section uses the new command, and Known limits now covers subagents that end without a `SubagentStop` event.

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-01)

- `proof-of-green status` shows what the gate would do right now: code files edited this turn, the test commands it recorded with their results, and a verdict. `--json` prints the same data as JSON.
- `PROOF_OF_GREEN_DEBUG=1` appends every hook payload, cut to 4096 characters, to `debug.log`.
- `doctor` checks the user and project config files and counts the valid and skipped tool entries.
- Claude Code subagents are checked when they stop, using only their own edits and test runs. A background subagent that is still running is left out of the main session's check, and the main session gets a note about it.
- `editTools` lets an MCP tool that edits files count as an edit.
- The ledger is now an append-only JSONL file, so hooks that run in parallel no longer overwrite each other's records. Ledgers from 0.2 are still read.
- `errors.log` and `debug.log` are cut to their last 32 KB once they pass 64 KB.
- Script names such as `test-e2e` and `test_unit` count as test commands.
- Fixes: MCP error results are detected more strictly, Codex tool input is accepted only as a plain object, code file paths are normalized before matching, and `status` respects a disabled gate.

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-01)

- `testTools` in `.proof-of-green.json` makes an MCP tool count as a test run, for example a tool that runs tests on a remote machine. The command in the tool's arguments goes through the same rules as a shell command, and the exit code is read from the tool's JSON response.
- A user-level `~/.proof-of-green.json` is read for every project and merged with the project's file.
- When the last test ran through an MCP tool, the block reason names that tool.
- A failing MCP command that the tool reports as an error is read as a failed test. An error result never counts as a pass.
- `node --test` counts as a test command.
- Running `install codex` again moves a 0.1 install to the new `PostToolUse` matcher. A matcher you edited by hand is left alone.
- `doctor` finds the Claude Code plugin's ledger folder, and no longer asks you to trust Codex hooks that aren't installed.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-31)

First release.

- A Stop hook for Claude Code (as a plugin) and Codex CLI (through `install codex`). It blocks the agent's stop once when code changed and no test passed after the last change.
- Test commands are recognized for npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, vitest, jest, mocha, playwright, pytest, go, cargo, dotnet, deno, maven, gradle, make, rspec, phpunit and mix, including through `uv run`, `poetry run` and similar wrappers.
- A command after the first test command must be joined with `&&`, so a later command can't hide a failed test. Shell calls run in the background never count.
- On Codex, exit codes are read from the session log.
- `.proof-of-green.json` can turn the gate off, add test command patterns, and include or exclude files.
- `doctor` reports whether the plugin and the Codex hooks are installed and trusted.
